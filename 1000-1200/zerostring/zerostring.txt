Problem
You are given a binary string 
�
S of length 
�
N. You are allowed to perform the following types of operations on string 
�
S:

Delete any one character from 
�
S, and concatenate the remaining parts of the string. For example, if we delete the third character of 
�
=
1101
S=1101, it becomes 
�
=
111
S=111.
Flip all the characters of 
�
S. For example, if we flip all character of 
�
=
1101
S=1101, it becomes 
�
=
0010
S=0010.
Given that you can use either type of operation any number of times, find the minimum number of operations required to make all characters of the string 
�
S equal to 
0
0.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
�
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains an integer 
�
N — the length of the string.
The next line contains a binary string 
�
S of length 
�
N.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the minimum number of operations required to make all characters of the string 
�
S equal to 
0
0.
