Problem
You are given an integer 
�
N.

Construct a permutation 
�
P of length 
�
N such that

For all 
�
i 
(

abs(P 
i+1
​
 −P 
i
​
 ).
Recall that a permutation of length 
�
N is an array where every integer from 
1
1 to 
�
N occurs exactly once.

It can be proven that for the given constraints at least one such 
�
P always exists.

Input Format
The first line of input contains a single integer 
�
T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of 
�
T test cases follow.
The only line of each test case contains an integer 
�
N - the length of the array to be constructed.
Output Format
For each test case, output a single line containing 
�
N space-separated integers 
�
1
,
