Problem
Chef has an array 
�
A of length 
�
N. In one operation, Chef can:

Choose any subarray 
[
�
,
�
]
[L,R] 
(
1
≤
�
≤
�
≤
�
)
(1≤L≤R≤N);
Add 
1
1 to 
�
�
A 
L
​
 , subtract 
1
1 from 
�
�
+
1
A 
L+1
​
 , add 
1
1 to 
�
�
+
2
A 
L+2
​
 , subtract 
1
1 from 
�
�
+
3
A 
L+3
​
  and so on, till 
�
�
A 
R
​
 .
Chef performed 
�
Q such operations where the 
�
�
ℎ
i 
th
  operation was performed on the subarray 
[
�
�
,
�
�
]
[L 
i
​
 ,R 
i
​
 ].

Determine the final sum of the array after these 
�
Q operations.

Note that a subarray is formed by deleting some (possibly zero) elements from the beginning and some (possibly zero) elements from the end of the array.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
�
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains two integers 
�
,
�
N,Q, number of elements and the number of queries.
The next line contains 
�
N space-separated integers 
�
1
,
�
2
,
…
�
�
A 
1
​
 ,A 
2
​
 ,…A 
N
​
  - denoting the array 
�
A.
The next 
�
Q lines contains two space-separated integers with 
�
�
ℎ
i 
th
  line containing 
�
�
,
�
�
L 
i
​
 ,R 
i
​
 .
Output Format
For each test case, output the final sum of the array after performing all the 
�
Q operations.
